# Indy smart contracts

### Prerequisites to run

* `node` > `v18.15.0`
* `yarn`

### Install dependencies

```
> yarn install
```

### Compile contracts

```
> yarn compile
```

The following folders should be generated as the result:

* `artifacts` - completed contract specification
* `typechain-types` - typescript bindings for contracts

### Run tests

```
> yarn test
```

### Main Contracts

* [AccountControl](./contracts/auth/AccountControlInterface.sol) - contract to manage permissions for transactions and new contracts deployment
    * [AccountControl TS contract wrapper class](./contracts-ts/AccountControl.ts)
* [RoleControl](./contracts/auth/RoleControlInterface.sol) - contract to manage (assign/revoke) account roles.
    * [RoleControl TS contract wrapper class](./contracts-ts/RoleControl.ts)
* [IndyDidRegistry](./contracts/did/IndyDidRegistry.sol) - `indybesu` DID Registry
    * [IndyDidRegistry TS contract wrapper class](./contracts-ts/IndyDidRegistry.ts)
* [EthereumExtDidRegistry](./contracts/did/EthereumExtDidRegistry.sol) - [Ethereum DID Registry](https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry/tree/master) extended with permission checks
    * [DidRegistry TS contract wrapper class](./contracts-ts/EthereumDIDRegistry.ts)
* [SchemaRegistry](contracts/anoncreds/SchemaRegistryInterface.sol) - contract to manage Schemas
    * [SchemaRegistry TS contract wrapper class](./contracts-ts/SchemaRegistry.ts)
* [CredentialDefinitionRegistry](contracts/anoncreds/CredentialDefinitionRegistryInterface.sol) - contract to manage Credential Definitions
    * [CredentialDefinitionRegistry TS contract wrapper class](./contracts-ts/CredentialDefinitionRegistry.ts)
* [ValidatorControl](./contracts/network/ValidatorControlInterface.sol) - contract to manage network validator nodes.
    * [ValidatorControl TS contract wrapper class](./contracts-ts/ValidatorControl.ts)
* [UpgradeControl](./contracts/upgrade/UpgradeControlInterface.sol) - contract to control deployed smart contracts and their versions (proposing and approving new versions).
    * [Upgrading TS contract wrapper class](./contracts-ts/UpgradeControl.ts)
* [LegacyMappingRegistry](./contracts/migration/LegacyMappingRegistryInterface.sol) - contract to store mapping for legacy identifiers.
    * [LegacyMappingRegistry TS contract wrapper class](./contracts-ts/LegacyMappingRegistry.ts)

### Demos

You can find sample scripts demonstrating the usage of deployed contracts in the [demo folder](./demos).

* [Account management](./demos/account-control.ts) - deploy/read/writer transactions.
    ```
    > yarn demo/account
    ```
* [Demo flow](./demos/flow.ts) - create/resolve DID/Schema/Credential Definition using `did:indy2` method.
    ```
    > yarn demo/flow
    ```
* [Demo flow](./demos/flow-with-did-ethr.ts) - create/resolve DID/Schema/Credential Definition using `did:ethr` method.
    ```
    > yarn demo/flow-with-did-ethr
    ```
* [Roles management](./demos/role-control.ts) - get/assign/revoke role to/from account.
    ```
    > yarn demo/roles
    ```
* [Upgrade management](./demos/upgrade-control.ts) - propose/approve upgradable contract implementation.
    ```
    > yarn demo/upgrade
    ```
* [Validators management](./demos/validator-control.ts) - get list of current validators.
    ```
    > yarn demo/validators
    ```

### Helper Scripts

* [Genesis](./scripts/genesis) - helper scripts to generate genesis state for injecting smart contracts.

> `socl` tool must be installed on the machine.

#### Steps

1. Prepare the [input file](scripts/genesis/config.ts) with the initial state of each contract.

2. Compile contracts:
   ```
   yarn solc-compile
   ```

    * `artifacts` and `compiled-contracts` folders with compiled contracts will be generated as the result of the execution.

3. Execute script generating the contracts content for the network genesis file:
   > yarn genesis/generate

    * `ContractsGenesis.json` file will be generated as the result

4. Put the whole block into the `alloc` section of the network genesis file.

5. **If you changed the default address of `ValidatorControl` contract**: Set address of `ValidatorControl` contract
   into `validatorcontractaddress` field of the `qbft` section of the genesis file.

6. **If you changed the default address of `AccountControl` contract**: Set address of `AccountControl` contract
   into `permissions-accounts-contract-address` field of the `config.toml`
   file.
